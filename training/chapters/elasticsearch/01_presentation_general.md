# General Overview

---

# Search Engines

* In our increasingly connected world, there has emerged a need to centralize various pieces of information.
* This is to:
    * structure,
    * query, and
    * manipulate
* ... information from different sources and in different structures.

---

# Search Engines

* The main goal is to have a solution that allows:
    * for quick and relevant searching, and
    * categorization of search results.

---
 
# Existing Solutions

* Several search engine solutions exist, including:
    * Java library: Lucene
    * Cluster: Solr, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch
    * SaaS Solution: Algolia, Amazon, Azure, GCP, Elastic Cloud...

--- 

# Lucene

* An open-source Java library for indexing documents.
* Can be integrated into your applications.
* Here is an example of Lucene code:

```java
String str = "foo bar";
String id = "123456";
BooleanQuery bq = new BooleanQuery();
Query query = qp.parse(str);
bq.add(query, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
bq.add(new TermQuery(new Term("id", id), BooleanClause.Occur.MUST_NOT);
```

# Elastic Stack

* An Elasticsearch cluster can be used as:
    * a search engine (Uber, Tinder, ...)
    * a solution for system observation (Blizzard, ...)
    * a SIEM (Indiana University, ...)
    * ...

--- 

# Elastic Stack

* The Elastic Stack is currently in version 8.12.0.
* The suite is composed of several products:
    * Elasticsearch
    * Kibana
    * Beats
    * APM
* ...

# Installation

* You can also use Elasticsearch via:

    * Docker
    * Elastic Cloud Enterprise
    * Elastic Cloud
    * Helm Chart for Kubernetes
    * GCP, AWS, Clevercloud Marketplace, etc.

```shell
docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.1
```

---

# Launching

* To start Elasticsearch, you need to execute one of the following commands:

```shell
./bin/elasticsearch
.\bin\elasticsearch.bat
```

* You should see the following result:

```shell
[Emmanuels-MBP] publish_address {127.0.0.1:9200}, bound_addresses {[::1]:9200}, {127.0.0.1:9200}
[Emmanuels-MBP] started
```

# Configuration

* To verify that your Elasticsearch cluster is functional

```shell
GET http://localhost:9200/
```

---

# Configuration

* should return this response

```json
{

  "cluster_name": "elasticsearch",

    "minimum_index_compatibility_version": "7.0.0"
  },
  "tagline": "You Know, for Search"
}
```

# Configuration

* Cluster configuration is done in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file

```yaml
cluster.name: my-application
node.name: node-1
http.port: 9200
discovery.seed_hosts: ["host1", "host2", "host3", "host4"]
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["host1", "host2"]

xpack.ml.enabled: false
xpack.security.enabled: true
```

---

# Nodes

* A node can be of different types
    * master
    * data
    * ingest
    * machine learning
    * transformer
    * cross cluster
    * ...

---

# Nodes

* Configuration is also done in the `elasticsearch.yml` file

```yaml
node.master: true
node.data: false
node.ingest: false
node.ml: false
```

---

# API

* Any endpoint containing a `_` corresponds to an Elasticsearch API
    * _search
    * _explain
    * _analyze
    * _cat
    * _reindex
    * ...

---

# Interacting with Elasticsearch

* You can interact with Elasticsearch using:
    * curl
    * an SDK (Java, JavaScript, Python, ...)
    * Postman
    * Kibana
