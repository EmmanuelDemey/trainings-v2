# Aggregations

---

# Aggregations

* An aggregation is a way to categorize our data.
* They can be performed on all fields with the `fielddata` parameter set to `true`.
* This parameter is `true` by default for all fields except those of type `text`.
    * It is possible to force the value of `fielddata` to `true` for analyzed `text` fields. This is a dangerous practice.
* For fields of type `text`, you must have a second representation of type `keyword`.

---

# Aggregations

* Aggregations are applied on the result of a query.
* It's another object block in the DSL.

```
POST person/_search
{
  "query": {
    ...
  },
  "aggs": {
    ...
  }
}
```

---

# Aggregations

* The result of aggregations will be added to the response.

```
POST person/_search
{
  "took" : 1,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {...},
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
      "value" : 5,
      "relation" : "eq"
    },
    "max_score" : 1.0,
    "hits" : [...]
  },
  "aggregations" : {
    ...
  }
}
```

---

# Aggregations

* It's possible not to return the `hits` of the query by setting `size` to `0`.

```
POST person/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    ...
  }
}
```

---

# Metric Aggregations

* Aggregation type that returns a metric.
    * e.g., calculating an average price.
* Impossible to create nested metrics.
* Several types available: `max`, `min`, `sum`, `avg`, `stats`, ...

---

# AVG Aggregations

```
POST /notes/_search?size=0
{
    "aggs" : {
        "avg_grade" : { "avg" : { "field" : "grade" } }

        "avg_grade": {
            "value": 75.0
        }
    }
}
```

---

# Bucket Aggregations

* Aggregation type that creates `buckets`.
* Each bucket can act as a sub-aggregation.
* Several types available: `Date`, `Filters`, `Terms`, `geo_distance`, ...

---

# Date Aggregations

```
POST /sales/_search?size=0

# Pipeline Aggregations

* Aggregation that works with the output of a previous aggregation.
* Two types of aggregations
    * Parent
    * Sibling

# Nested Aggregations

* As soon as we use `bucket` type aggregations, we can nest them.
