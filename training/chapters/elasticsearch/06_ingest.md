# Ingest Pipelines

---

# What Are Ingest Pipelines?

* A series of processors that pre-process documents before indexing
* Allows transformation, enrichment, and manipulation of data
* Each pipeline consists of one or more processors executed in order

```
PUT _ingest/pipeline/my_pipeline
{
  "description": "My first ingest pipeline",
  "processors": [
    {
      "set": {
        "field": "field_name",
        "value": "value"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```
node.ingest: false
```

# Why Use Ingest Pipelines? 

* Data normalization and standardization
* Enrichment with additional data sources
* Removal of unnecessary data fields
* Improved indexing efficiency and search relevance
* Case Studies:
  * Log data normalization for centralized logging systems
  * Enriching e-commerce transactions with customer data
  * Preprocessing social media data for sentiment analysis

# Core Components of an Ingest Pipeline

* Processors: Perform operations on documents
* Conditions: Define when a processor should be executed
* Failures: Handling of processing errors

```json
{
  "processors": [
    { "set": { "field": "new_field", "value": "value" } },
    { "remove": { "field": "unwanted_field" } }
  ],
  "on_failure": [
    { "set": { "field": "error", "value": "{{ _ingest.on_failure_message }}" } }
  ]
}
```

---

# Common Processors

* Set, Remove, Rename: Modify fields
* Grok: Parses unstructured text
* Date: Parses and formats dates
* GeoIP: Adds geographical information based on IP

```json
{
  "grok": { 
    "field": "message", 
    "patterns": ["%{IP:client} %{WORD:method} %{URIPATHPARAM:request} %{NUMBER:bytes} %{NUMBER:duration}"] 
  },
  "date": { "field": "timestamp", "formats": ["ISO8601"] },
  "geoip": { "field": "client" }
}
```

---

# Creating an Ingest Pipeline

* Define the pipeline in the Elasticsearch API
* Specify processors and their order
* Test the pipeline with sample data

```
PUT _ingest/pipeline/my_custom_pipeline
{
  "processors": [
    { "remove": { "field": "temp_field" } },
    { "rename": { "field": "old_name", "target_field": "new_name" } }
  ]
}
```

---

# How the Simulate API Works

* Define a pipeline or use an existing one
* Specify one or more sample documents to test
* Analyze the output to understand how the pipeline transforms the data

```
POST _ingest/pipeline/_simulate
{
  "pipeline": {
    "description": "Test pipeline",
    "processors": [
      { "set": { "field": "new_field", "value": "value" } }
    ]
  },
  "docs": [
    { "_source": { "field1": "data1" } }
  ]
}
```

---

# How to use an Ingest Pipeline

* Index Templates

```
PUT _index_template/my_template
{
  "index_patterns": ["logs-*"],
  "template": {
    "settings": {
      "default_pipeline": "my_ingest_pipeline"
    }
  }
}
```

* When Reindexing

```
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "existing-index"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "new-index",
    "pipeline": "my_ingest_pipeline"
  }
}
```

* When indexing

```
PUT /my-index/_doc/1?pipeline=my_ingest_pipeline
{
  "field1": "value1",
  "field2": "value2"
}
```

# Best Practices

* Start with simple pipelines and incrementally add complexity
* Use the simulate API to test pipelines
  * Use realistic document samples for accurate testing
  * Test with different variations of input data to cover all use cases
  * Combine multiple processors to see cumulative effects
  * Utilize the on_failure section to handle errors gracefully
* Monitor pipeline performance and errors
* Keep documentation up to date
