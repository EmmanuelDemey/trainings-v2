# Elasticsearch

The material of the **Elasticsearch** training (3 days): a slide deck, hands-on
workshops, and the site that publishes them — built by
[training-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emmanueldemey/training-kit).

```
slides/            one Markdown file per chapter (Slidev)
  public/images/   the images of the deck, referenced as /images/…
workshops/         one folder per workshop, its README.md (in French)
training.config.mjs
```

## Write

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run list       # what the numbering picks up, and what it leaves out
pnpm run dev        # the deck, live — http://localhost:3030
pnpm run site       # the workshops site, live — http://localhost:4321
```

**The number at the start of a name is its place.** `slides/03_….md` is
chapter 3, `workshops/03_…/` is workshop 3; `10_…` comes after `9_…`. A
name that starts with `_` is turned off — kept on disk, left out of the deck, the
site, the PDFs and the ZIPs. There is no list to maintain anywhere else.

## Build

```bash
pnpm run build          # everything, into build/
pnpm run build:fast     # without the PDF exports (the slow part)
pnpm dlx serve build    # serve it as Netlify will
```

The downloads: `elasticsearch-slides.pdf`, `elasticsearch-workshops.pdf`,
`elasticsearch-participants.zip`, plus a starter ZIP per workshop under
`downloads/tp/`.

The workshops are guided — each README holds the requests to send from Kibana
Dev Tools and the responses to expect — so there are no solutions and no online
editor.

The PDF exports print with Chromium. To use one already on the machine instead
of downloading Playwright's, set `TRAINING_KIT_CHROME` to its path.

## Deploy

A Netlify site of its own, built and deployed by
[`deploy-trainings.yml`](../.github/workflows/deploy-trainings.yml): every push to
`main` that touches this folder deploys it, and a pull request gets
a preview. Nothing to set up in the Netlify UI — the site is created on its first
deploy. [`netlify.toml`](netlify.toml) only carries the headers.

With no `solutions/`, the CI has no workshop to check
([`workshops-ci.mjs`](../scripts/workshops-ci.mjs)) and goes straight to the deploy.
